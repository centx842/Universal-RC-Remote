# RC Toy Remote Control App

Welcome to the RC Toy Remote Control App! This project is designed to create a small, versatile remote control application for RC toys, styled after the familiar button layout of an Xbox controller. Built with Python and HTML, this app operates as both a desktop .NET application and a mobile application, offering seamless control over RC toys via Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and RF communication modes.

## Features

- **Xbox-Inspired Button Layout**: The app mirrors the intuitive design of an Xbox controller, making it easy to control RC toys with a familiar interface.
- **Cross-Platform Support**:
  - **Desktop**: Runs as a .NET application on Windows.
  - **Mobile**: Compatible with Android and iOS devices.
- **Communication Options**:
  - Bluetooth: For short-range, direct connections.
  - Wi-Fi: For networked control over greater distances.
  - RF (Radio Frequency): For robust, hardware-supported communication.
- **Mode Switching**: A dedicated button or UI element allows users to switch between Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and RF modes effortlessly.
- **Tech Stack**:
  - **Python**: Powers the backend logic and communication protocols.
  - **HTML**: Crafts a responsive, visually appealing frontend interface.

## Requirements

To develop and run this app, you'll need:

- **Python 3.x**: For backend development and communication handling.
- **.NET Framework**: For the desktop application (Windows).
- **Mobile Development Tools**: Android Studio (for Android) and Xcode (for iOS).
- **Communication Libraries**: Specific libraries for Bluetooth (e.g., PyBluez), Wi-Fi (e.g., sockets), and RF (e.g., PySerial or hardware-specific modules).

## How It Works

- **Frontend**: The HTML-based interface replicates an Xbox controller layout, capturing user inputs (e.g., button presses, joystick movements) and sending them to the backend.
- **Backend**: Python processes these inputs and communicates with the RC toy using the selected mode (Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or RF).
- **Mode Switching**: A UI toggle updates the backend to use the chosen communication protocol dynamically.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rc-toy-remote.git
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Python: `pip install -r requirements.txt` (update with specific libraries).
   - .NET: Ensure the .NET Framework is installed.
   - Mobile: Set up Android Studio and Xcode as needed.
3. **Run the App**:
   - Desktop: Launch the .NET application.
   - Mobile: Build and deploy via your chosen mobile framework.

## Development Notes

- **Desktop**: Integrate Python with .NET using tools like IronPython or subprocesses.
- **Mobile**: Consider frameworks like BeeWare or Kivy for Python-based mobile apps with HTML frontends.
- **Communication**: Test with actual RC toys to ensure compatibility across all modes.
